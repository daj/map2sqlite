This fork of map2sqlite is an attempt to get it to work with the [Mapbox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk).  It is still a work in progress.

map2sqlite is an OS X binary, only for use on Macs.

It is intended to be used to convert OpenStreetMap map tiles downloaded with `downloadosmtiles.pl` into a SQLite database that can be used with the Mapbox iOS SDK.

The original instructions I was following are here:
